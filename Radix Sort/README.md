## Radix sort algorithm

Given a document of binary floats, sorts the numbers on a per-digit basis through the usage of buckets. Comparing of binary floats, where digits are ints is done using the union. mmap is used to access the binary values, as they could number well into the millions. The program finishes execution when the sorted numbers have been mapped into the input file.<br />
