## Radix sort algorithm

Given a document of binary floats, sorts the numbers on a per-digit basis through the usage of buckets. Comparing of binary floats, where digits are ints is done using the union. mmap is used to access the binary values, as they could number well into the millions. The program finishes execution when the sorted numbers have been mapped into the input file.<br />
 
The RadixString variant has to sort a random amount of strings from [1,1000], these strings are of variable length, up to 22 characters. The amount of strings, and the length of each individual string is produced by the code, hence it takes no user input since it makes its own. The program creates its own input txt file, f.txt.
Since there are 26 letters in the latin alphabet, plus space characters for strings that are not the full 22 characters long, there are 27 buckets sorting all of the strings. Since C has character arrays instead of proper Strings in the sense that languages like Java do, there would be an array of buckets, each having an array of character arrays. Instead, I had a hard-coded array of 27 buckets, since that will absolutely never change, consisting of singly linked lists that each have a character array to hold the string. This way, the individual bucket size can be adapted to whatever strings happen to land on them. As each round of sorting occurs, the results are recorded on an mmap pointer, which in the end writes its results to a txt file, g.txt.
