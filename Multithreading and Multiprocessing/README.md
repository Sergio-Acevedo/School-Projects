## Multithread and multiprocessing exercises

### Sum
Sum file will take in a number for number of desired threads, and a file from which to read numbers from. It will then assign each thread an interval of the number list, determined by the thread number, and the file size nary floats. Each thread will add all numbers in their respective intervals, and at the end, each sum will be added up, yielding the total sum of the document. <br /> 

### π
π file will take a number for desired amount of processes, and a value representing how accurate the approximation should be. Problem was about working with inter-process communication methods.
